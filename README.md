CFG - Collectible Figures Game.
This is a game about battles between collectible creature models.
All figures were take from Unity Store.

This game has an artificial intelligence, so you can fight against AI.
You can move your figures, attack the enemy figures and play new cards from your hand.
Your goal is to kill the goblin of the enemy.

This is not a commercial project. This is a hobby. This is a joint development with my friend.
